📊 Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It leverages real-world churn behavior data and applies models like Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting to identify patterns in customer retention and attrition. A simple HTML-based UI is also developed for interactive prediction.

🔍 Problem Statement Customer churn is a major concern for businesses aiming to retain users. This project aims to:

Analyze customer behavior patterns.

Build predictive models to forecast churn.

Deploy a simple interface for business users to test predictions.
